HELP TO PREVENT HATE
__Overview__
The ‘Help to PREVENT Hate!’ is a website for people to keep our country and communities in the UK safe from those that target vulnerable individuals by spreading hate and negative ideologies and cause fear in our communities. This site is for parents, concerned citizens and professionals working with vulnerable groups who want to keep their communities safe from hate and terrorism. It is for people who want to know more about what the PREVENT strategy is, what to look for and, most importantly, how to report any concerns to the relevant authorities. This site will signpost parents, neighbours and professionals to places they can gain information and support, and provide links to where professional training for both individuals and professional teams can be accessed.

__Features__
--Call to Action--
 Each section will feature at least one 'REPORT A CONCERN' button to navigate directly to the 'REPORT A CONCERN' form to allow the user to immediately act once the information provided triggers the user to act.
 The 'REPORT A CONCERN' buttons are styled to be large and bright to draw attention. To avoid viewing more than one button at once in the display on large screens, some of the buttons are hidden when the screen width reaches 992 pixels.

--Home Page--
 The Home Page will have an eye-catching headline and image and quickly show:
  -What the ‘Help to PREVENT Hate!’ site is for.
  -Who will benefit (those at risk/parents/professionals/wider community) – includes gov.uk information video.
  -What behaviours may cause enough concern to report.
  -What to do if you have a concern.
  -How to access relevant support and/or training.

--Navigation Bar--
 Featured on all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Useful Links section, and Report a Concern form, and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

--Services Cards--
This section contains three cards to target some of the users likely to visit the page – concerned parents, citizens who want to help and those in fear of crowds due to recent terror activities. Each card has an image that conveys possible situations, some informative text and a logo that links to a relevant website when clicked. 

--Useful Links Table--
 A table of signposts for different user groups (individuals, concerned citizens, those concerned about family members, teachers and leaders of educational establishments) that link to the relevant websites that provide the relevant information: for example, the ‘Teacher’ user who needs classroom resources will be directed directly to the ‘Resources’ page of the educate.against.hate website (https://www.educateagainsthate.com/). Each link directs the user to non-previously used page of the various websites that are available to access. 

--The Footer--
The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for news and updates. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
The You-tube icon links directly to relevant you-tube videos about the Prevent strategy and includes testimonials from those who have been helped and/or supported by PREVENT specialist support schemes.
The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to maintain awareness via social media.


--Report a Concern Form--
 Accessible from the navbar and from the numerous 'REPORT A CONCERN' buttons clearly visible at various strategic points on the Home page. 
 The form contains 10 questions, many of which are required fields to complete. Due to the sensitive nature of the information and the reluctance of many people to report such incidents, the desire to maintain anonymity is respected, and contact details fields are therefore not a requirement. Reassurance is provided prior to submission that anonymity will be respected if requested, and information about what will happen with the information is also provided.

--Success Page--
 This page is only visible once a form is completed and not accessible through the navbar. The page thanks the user, provides reassurance about what will happen next, and offers further support via a link (link-styled logo button) to the ‘Victim Support’ website, or an option to return to the homepage.

__Features Left to Implement__
--Additional services cards--
To represent other user groups who would benefit from the individualized information and direction provided.

--Testimonials--
Could be presented in the form of a carousel of notes in the header or underneath each of the services cards once additional user groups have been added 
-or-
 videos could be a larger more prominent feature as a secondary page on the site accessible via a link button or the navbar.
