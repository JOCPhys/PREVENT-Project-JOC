Dillon can you please confirm that the course finishes on 6th or 7th February 2025? I am looking to book a holiday for after we've finished :)

Hey Joanna, how are you? :blobwave:
How are you finding this week? :slightly_smiling_face:

tough day yesterday tbh, first time I've had a real coding issue (got through that) but then was raging that the SME session was a waste of time (so frustrating) - I should've used your breathing techniques because I was then on one for the rest of the day because the SME put me behind on KPIs too - with plans last night so couldn't catch up - I realise now I have also been a bit under the weather with headaches which didn't help, but today I'm back in the room with a clear headspace (so far!l) - I'll be grand x
9:36
Thansk for asking! Hope you're feeling better

Ah thats tough Joanna, Your not massively behind so use today to catch up and reset and you will be good :slightly_smiling_face:
I'll try keep the guided session short to allow people to focus on KPIs
Thanks :smile:

Bit concerned that Mark doesn't take us on when we bring something up - it was clearly stated the previous day that he would guide us through setting up GitPod and GitHub and if we hadn't already he would take us through it step by step in the session and not to do it beforehand  - in the session he was annoyed we hadn't done it  (forgot what he'd said the previous day), whizzed through slides that were too small to read at the time and moved on to workspaces for those already set up on Git - there was a large group of us then left behind scratching our heads trying to set it up while he went ahead with what those ahead wanted to know  - ideally he should have spent 30 mins or so with us novices and told the others to join later - those of us that were then left  to set it up during the rest of the session were really frustrated and have no clue what he did in the rest of the session wrt setting up files etc because we weren't there yet. I wonder if he is not aware that we are not all as advanced as some of the others? If we had been told to set it up prior, no-one would have had a problem with that, but it caused a lot of upset in the group.

Thanks for letting me know this Joanna, it's important feedback to get :slightly_smiling_face:
In our guided session today I will be helping with this at the end but thanks for the honest feedback :+1:

I didn't want it to come across as a rant if I said it yesterday, so left it until today (remove the chimp response and all that). Hope it helps.


dillon_mccaffrey_ci
